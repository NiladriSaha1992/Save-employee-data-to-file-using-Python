# Save-employee-data-to-file-using-Python

This program is based on the concept of Python OOP. Here, data will be collected from user about an employee and will be saved to a file called 'employee_details.txt'. For each iteration of while loop an employee object will be created and the employee details will be saved to the text file by calling the 'saveEmpInfo' method.
